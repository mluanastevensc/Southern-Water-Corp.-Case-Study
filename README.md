# Southern-Water-Corp.-Case-Study

Scenario Overview
It’s been a turbulent year for the management of Southern Water Corp. With improved
revenues, management was cautiously optimistic. After years of relatively quiet market
behavior, new policy regulations have opened up the market to increased competition
which saw increased volumes of water purchased and traded on both the Open Water
Market as well as in private, residential, and industrial markets. This increase in trade
has continued to attract more market participants, leading to an increase in the
desalinated water supply. This increase in desalinated water resulted in a shift in
demand, resulting in lower Open Water Market prices for desalinated water.
Additionally, at the annual board meeting, the chairman raised the below concern:
“While the year’s performance has been favorable because of improved market demand
and pricing, this is likely to be short term. We should focus our attention on the upcoming
major maintenance events forecasted for 2014 and understand what the impact of these
events are on our revenues, operating costs and our respective EBIT. Additionally, we
should look at whether there is a change in the economic competitiveness of our units
when comparing the 2013-2014 Period versus the Forecast Cost Curves.”
Further analysis by the Financial Business Unit (FBU) and Commercial Business Unit
(CBU) presented an objective view of Southern Water Corps’ financial and economic
health. Management has been made aware of this and because you worked on both the 
FBU and CBU teams, they’ve requested that you draft up a high-level presentation. This
presentation is to highlight the key findings FBU and CBU identified with respect to:
● The EBIT 2013/14 vs Forecast
● Revenues 2013/14 vs Forecast
● Operating Costs 2013 vs Forecast
● Economic Pricing (Cost Curve Simulation) contrasting the 2013/14 Cost Curve
versus the Forecast
